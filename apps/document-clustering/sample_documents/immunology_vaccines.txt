The immune system defends the body against infections and diseases. White blood cells, antibodies, and other mechanisms identify and destroy pathogens. Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize specific diseases without causing illness. Immunization has eliminated or greatly reduced many infectious diseases like polio, measles, and smallpox worldwide.
