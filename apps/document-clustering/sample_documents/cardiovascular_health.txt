The cardiovascular system includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood that circulate throughout the body. Regular exercise strengthens the heart muscle and improves circulation. A healthy diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits and vegetables reduces risk of heart disease. Monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels helps prevent cardiovascular problems.
