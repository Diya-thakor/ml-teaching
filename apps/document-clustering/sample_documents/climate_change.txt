Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. Human activities, particularly burning fossil fuels, release greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Rising temperatures cause melting ice caps, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. Reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to renewable energy are crucial for mitigating climate impacts.
