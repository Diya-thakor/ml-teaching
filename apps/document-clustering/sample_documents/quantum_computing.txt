Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform calculations. Unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum bits or qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This enables quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. IBM, Google, and other companies are developing quantum processors with increasing qubit counts.
