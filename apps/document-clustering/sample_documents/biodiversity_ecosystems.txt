Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, including different species, genes, and ecosystems. Tropical rainforests, coral reefs, and wetlands harbor rich biodiversity. Habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change threaten species with extinction. Protecting biodiversity maintains ecosystem services like pollination, water purification, and climate regulation essential for human survival.
