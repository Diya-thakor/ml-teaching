Athletic training develops strength, speed, endurance, and skill for sports performance. Training programs include cardiovascular exercise, resistance training, flexibility work, and sport-specific drills. Proper warm-up prevents injuries, while cool-down aids recovery. Nutrition and rest are essential components of effective training. Athletes track progress and adjust training based on performance goals.
