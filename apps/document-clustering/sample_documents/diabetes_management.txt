Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting how the body processes blood sugar. Type 1 diabetes results from insufficient insulin production, while Type 2 involves insulin resistance. Managing diabetes requires monitoring blood glucose levels, taking medications as prescribed, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly. Untreated diabetes can lead to serious complications affecting eyes, kidneys, nerves, and cardiovascular system.
