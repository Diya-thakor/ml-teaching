Strength and conditioning programs build muscle, power, and athletic performance. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses work multiple muscle groups. Progressive overload gradually increases weight or resistance over time. Adequate protein intake supports muscle growth and recovery. Periodization cycles training intensity and volume to optimize results and prevent plateaus.
