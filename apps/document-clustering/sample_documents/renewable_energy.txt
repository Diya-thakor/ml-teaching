Renewable energy comes from natural sources that replenish continuously. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, while wind turbines harness wind power. Hydroelectric dams generate power from flowing water. These clean energy sources produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. Battery storage technology enables renewable energy to provide reliable baseload power.
