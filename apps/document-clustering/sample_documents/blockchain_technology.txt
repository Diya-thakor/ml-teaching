Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records called blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain. This technology enables secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions without intermediaries. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on blockchain infrastructure.
