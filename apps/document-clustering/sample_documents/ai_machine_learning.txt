Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, form the foundation of deep learning. These algorithms can recognize patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time through training on large datasets. Applications include computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.
