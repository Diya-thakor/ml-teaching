Marathon running is a long-distance race covering 26.2 miles. Training for a marathon requires gradually building weekly mileage over several months. Long runs develop endurance, while tempo runs and intervals improve speed. Proper running shoes, hydration during runs, and recovery days prevent overuse injuries. Race day strategy includes pacing, fueling, and mental preparation.
