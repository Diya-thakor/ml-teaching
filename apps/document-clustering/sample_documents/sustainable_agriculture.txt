Sustainable agriculture produces food while preserving environmental resources for future generations. Practices include crop rotation, composting, water conservation, and integrated pest management. Organic farming avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Sustainable methods improve soil health, reduce pollution, and support local food systems. Regenerative agriculture can even sequester carbon and help mitigate climate change.
