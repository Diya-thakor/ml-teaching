Oceans cover over 70 percent of Earth's surface and support diverse marine ecosystems. Ocean pollution from plastics, chemicals, and oil spills threatens marine life and coral reefs. Overfishing depletes fish populations and disrupts food chains. Conservation efforts include marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices, and reducing plastic waste. Healthy oceans regulate climate and provide food for billions of people.
